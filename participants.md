Zhengchun Liu is a Research Scientist at the Computation Institute of the University of Chicago. He also holds a Joint Appointment at the Data Science and Learning division of Argonne National Laboratory. In this project, he develops end-to-end analytical performance models to transform understanding of the behavior of science workflows in extreme-scale science environments. More specifically, these models are developed to predict the behavior of a science workflow before it is implemented, to explain why performance does not meet design goals, and to architect science environments to meet workflow needs.
