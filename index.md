# About

__SciStream__: _Architecture and toolkit for data stream-ing between federated science instruments_ project is fund by the U.S. National Science Foundation's CC* Integration-Large program. 

# Mission 
Technological advancements enable scientific instruments to generate data at unprecedented rates. 
However, data are often processed at a rate far below the capability of the instruments leading to either operating the instruments at a lower data rate (e.g., detectors at light sources); and/or discarding a (significant) portion of the data without processing (e.g., cosmology simulations).
To alleviate these issues, we propose to  design and implement solutions for efficient and secure memory-to-memory data streaming between geographically distributed and federated scientific instruments. 
Lack of direct external network connectivity for scientific instruments,  mismatch of authentication and security requirements between batch and stream processing, and absence of the software stacks and tools for accommodating data streams are the key challenges in providing such capability. 
We propose to (1) develop an architecture to enable data streaming from a producer’s memory at one facility to a consumer’s memory at another remote facility through a small set of gateway nodes at both facilities; (2) create protocols to establish authenticated and transparent connection between producer and consumer via gateway nodes; (3) build on our current prototype and develop additional tools to realize the proposed architecture in an operational environment and develop APIs to facilitate data streaming.
